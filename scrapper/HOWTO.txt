This is a custom app to scrap prices from Amazon, Game, Fnac or MediaMarkt shops (for videogames especially). 
This works because I am only scrapping one time each 10 minutes (less time makes Amazon throw you a captcha).
You have a Google Sheet with the url that you want to scrap, and Google Apps Scripts sends that petition to the app in that docker
that scraps it and sends back the data to the Sheet, where the price is updated and if it is less than your custom threshold alerts
you by email.

Files in this path:
Dockerfile - File to build the docker image
*.py - files that needs to be in the pv when mounting the docker-compose (you can find it in /root in this repo)
Code.gs - Google Apps Script that works with a Google Sheet.
Google Sheet structure:
Columns - Formula
A	 	  None, manual info: "Name of the shop"
B	 	  None, manual info: "Platform"
C	 	  None, manual info: "Game"
D	 	  None, automatic: "Price"
E	 	  None, automatic lowest seen price: "Lowest"
F	 	  None, manual alert threshold that sends you an email: "Alert"
G	 	  None, manual url: "URL"
H		  =MID(G1,(FIND("www.", G1)+4),(FIND(".", G1,14))-(FIND("www.", G1)+4)) - extract name shop from url
I		  =IF(NE(J1, ""),J1, IF(NE(K1,""),K1,IF(NE(L1,""),L1,IF(NE(M1,""),M1)))) - gets the right ASIN from the next 4 columns
J   		  =IF(H1 = "game",RIGHT(G1,6),"") - extract the needed ASIN if the url is from Game
K  		  =IF(H1 = "amazon",MID(G1,FIND("dp/",G1)+3,10),"") - extract the needed ASIN if the url is from Amazon
L		  =IF(H1 = "mediamarkt", MID(G1,FIND("product/",G1)+8,LEN(G1)+1-(FIND("product/",G1)+8)),"") - extract the needed ASIN if the url is from MediaMarkt
M		  =IF(H1 = "fnac",MID(G1,FIND("/a",G1)+1,8),"") - extract the needed ASIN if the url is from Fnac

You need to configure aswell that Google triggers your code each 10 minutes.
